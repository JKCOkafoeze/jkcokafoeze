Hi there 👋

I champion a culture of trusted, accurate, consistent, and secure data to support reliable decisions and meet regulatory expectations. I focus on supporting organisations get real value from their data, particularly where estates are fragmented and trust is low. I help clients understand what data they have, how reliable it is, and where to focus first to unlock value.
